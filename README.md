# 🧠 Novice Student Researcher — Document Quality Review Tools

This repository contains Python tools and scripts developed during my time as a **Novice Student Researcher** at **Illinois State University**. The goal of this work was to assist with **automated document quality review** in a digitized newspaper archive consisting of over **23,000 files**.

These scripts contributed to a larger machine learning workflow that identified poorly scanned or low-quality documents for potential rescanning.

## 🧩 Project Highlights

- ✅ Built and iterated on Python scripts to analyze scanned text content  
- 🤖 Developed a lightweight model to detect likely bad scans based on word frequency and structure  
- 📊 Improved model accuracy by refining features and reducing false positives  
- 🔁 Designed reusable modules to automate repetitive archival QA tasks  
- 📂 Helped streamline rescanning efforts by flagging problematic files across a large dataset

## 📁 Folder Overview

This repo includes subfolders representing various stages and components of the project:


- `Join word list` — Utilities for combining multiple word frequency files into structured datasets  
- `Word count` / `Word_count` — Scripts for counting and analyzing word frequency in text files  
- `Words in text file` / `Words_in_text_file` — Tools for parsing, extracting, and organizing words from raw document text  
- `module` — Core automation scripts that integrate and run the other components as a streamlined, end-to-end document quality review process  


(Note: Some folder names may overlap due to different experimental versions.)
